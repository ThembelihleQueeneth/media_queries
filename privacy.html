        What is a Data Protection Impact Assessment?
    </h2>
    <p>
        When your organisation collects, stores, or uses personal data, the individuals 
        whose data you are processing are exposed to risks. These risks range from 
        personal data being stolen or inadvertently released and used by criminals to 
        impersonate the individual, to worry being caused to individuals that their data will 
        be used by your organisation for unknown purposes. A Data Protection Impact 
        Assessment (DPIA) describes a process designed to identify risks arising out of the 
        processing of personal data and to minimise these risks as far and as early as 
        possible. DPIAs are important tools for negating risk, and for demonstrating 
        compliance with the GDPR.
